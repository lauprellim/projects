"""
Micropython program for Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Reads distance from HC-SR04
- Uses a button to cycle through students' OSC modes
- Reads a potentiometer for volume control
- Sends data over UDP to Pd

Use a 10 or 100 kohm linear potentiometer. Remember to wire 3.3V -> outer lug,
ground to other outer lug, and wiper goes to Pico ADC (ADC 26 in this case).
You can wire a small RC filter on the wiper for steader readings, but
that's not necessary. If you want add a 0.1uF capacitor from wiper to ground.

Don't send 5V to the wiper because the pico's ADC is only 3.3V.
